    "# Pre-processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokenization is a crucial pre-processing step in the NLP domain`*`. However, other pre-processing techniques also exist, many of which were extensively employed in rule-based and statistical NLP. While we don't utilise these pre-processing techniques in neural-based NLP anymore, they are still worth a recap. Typically, **stop words** and **punctuation** removal are employed, along with *either* **stemming** or **lemmatization**. However, in the following code, we will demonstrate each of the techniques separately (mainly due to our corpus being so small)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stop Word removal\n",
    "Stop words are generally the most common words in the language which who's meaning in a sequenece is ambiguous. Some examples of stop words are: The, a, an, that.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Punctuation removal\n",
    "Old school NLP techniques (and some modern day ones) struggle to understand the semantics of punctuation. Thus, they were also removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stemming and Lemmatization\n",
    "Stemming and Lemmatization are two distinct word normalization techniques. Essentially this means that, given our corpora, we wish to have variants of a word in a 'normal' form. For example, [playing, plays, played] may be normalised to \"Play\". The sentence \"the boy's cars are different colours\" may be normalised to \"the boy car be differ colour\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stemming\n",
    "In the case of stemming, we want to normalise all words to their stem (or root). The stem is the part of the word to which affixes (suffixes or prefixes) are assigned. Stemming a word may result in the word not actually being a word. For example, some stemming algorithms may stem [trouble, troubling, troubled] as \"troubl\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lemmatization\n",
    "Lemmatization attempts to properly reduce unnormalized tokens to a word that belongs in the language. The root word is called a **lemma**, and is the canonical form of a set of words. For example, [runs, running, ran] are all forms of the word \"run.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q. Think of two or three other stop words, and add them to the list of stop words below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q. Using the examples provided below, write some code which both removes stop words and punctuation from our corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "Q. The examples of stemming and lemmatization below are on words/sequences not in our corpus. Extend the code so it works on our corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 10 mins \n",
    "\n",
    "N.B. We are not going to use these techniques in this file after this section, so we will demonstrate how to perform these techniques distinctly on our toy corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "`*`Recently there has been newer approaches to \"tokenization\" which goes further than one token being one word. One example is [SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece). These approaches are out of scope for this lab session, but may appear in future sessions"
