To be more precise, we will build a feed-forward neural network (FFNN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN). We will look into the details of data preparation, functioning of each model and how the performance of those NNs could be measured efficiently. We will start our work using a toy corpus, so we can then extend our models to larger datasets.\n",
