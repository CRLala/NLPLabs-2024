But their plan was not to be . Caught and detained by the Yemeni authorities , the 600 or so men now await deportation , prevented from leaving their makeshift jail by armed soldiers . Conditions at the warehouse are growing increasingly desperate . Several days ago , the authorities stopped handing out food and basic supplies . "" I came from Djibouti to work . They used to give us small amounts of food . If there is no food , we will die , "" said one migrant who declined to give his name . "" If there is no solution , they will deport us to our countries or get us out of here "" , the man added .
