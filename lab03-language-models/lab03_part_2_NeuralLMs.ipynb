A basic FFLM constructs a  $C=n\\mathrm{-1}$ length context window before the word to be predicted. If the word embedding size is $E$, the feature vector for the context window becomes a vector of size $E\\times C$, resulting from the **concatenation** of individual word embeddings of context words.
